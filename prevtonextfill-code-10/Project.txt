The game is simple clicker, for those who like snake and minesweeper.

 For example, you can reach point (i+1) only moving from piont (i).

You can reach point (2) only if you reached point (1), by moving from point one.

If you like, it you can add more levels in the game_fields.cpp:InitializeGlobalFields() and recompile.
